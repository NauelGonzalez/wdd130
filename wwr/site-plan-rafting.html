Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
     
      Located on Titan, the biggest natural satellite of Saturn,  <b>Vid Flumina</b> is one of the few flowing rivers outside planet Earth. It's lenght is compared with the Nile, a lengh over 400km.
      This impresive river flows liquid methane, a highly flammable gas. Only the bravest will dare to tame its course.
      <br>
      Titan's Rafting explores a whole new way to experience whitewater rafting!, literally something outside of this world.
      <br>
      Planning to start operating in March 2060, Titan's Rafting is the first company taking the sport to a whole new level.

    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>

      If you thought parachuting, shark diving or even flying to the International Space Station was the most exciting experience wait to see what Titan has to offer.
