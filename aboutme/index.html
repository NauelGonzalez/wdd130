    <p> Hey everyone, by now you already know my name &#9786;. I'm 33 years old and happily married with my soulmate.
    <br> 
        I live in Uruguay, in a peaceful neighborhood ironically called "La Paz"
    <br>
        The house wasn't empty when we bought it, but my wife and I decided to include the previous owners in our family and we all have been blessed since then.
    <br>
    <br>
        Here are some pics of the previous owners posing for the camera:

        Regarding my church membership, my parents were baptized when I was 5, and I've been a member since that time. I served my mission in Salta, Argentina back in 2008/10.

        I love to understand how things work behind the scenes. Since I was a kid I used to dismantle every device I could put my hands on and tried to understand how all the parts worked together.
    <br>   
        With programming the feeling is similar, you get to understand how and why the magic happens.
