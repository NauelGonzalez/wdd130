      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone loves to have a day off from work when holidays arrive, but few can actually appreciate the holiday’s spirit.
        Even if a picture is worth more than a thousand words it can´t express the emotions of the people involved in the celebration, it can’t describe the temperature outside the room, the smell of those tasty cookies only granny knows how to make, it can't explain the motives why people gathered or what happen after that  instant.  It is true that some pictures are worth more than a thousand words… but the correct words can create unlimited and vastly detailed pictures in our minds, words can guide our imagination not only to see the picture but  to smell the moment, hear the laughs and feel the warmth in our hearts.
        
        As time passes by, details vanish and things that once were clear and precious to us risk to be forgotten.  People will find in holitales a place to relive those moments of happiness or remember life lessons. Sometimes the experiences are so valuable that you simply want to share them with other people and give them a place to last.
        
        Other people could find joy and comfort by reading stories and get the companionship we all need from time to time.

        In the beginning holidates will work for christmas stories, but the idea is to cover all different types of celebrations across the world since every holiday 
        Users will visit holitales for fun stories and to recover faith in humanity.

      <h3>Holidays Fun Facts</h3>
      <p>
       
        The site will also provide useful information about the celebrations and some interesting details and statistics about it. 
        This way people can know why we celebrate, its origins and even some similar celebrations around the world.
        People will not visit holitales to get academic knowledge or food delivery services nearby. Instead Visitors will navigate this site to talk about the time they made the spookiest decoration from the block on Halloween, or to share experiences when they participated in the village choir and sang Christmas carols on the main square. 
        Having a page to understand the traditions and significance of the celebrations will help people around the globe to understand the stories better.

      </ul>
      <h3>Share Your Story</h3>
      <p>
        The more stories the people read, the more they will feel identified and their desire to share their own experiences will grow making the site to be renovated all the time. 
        Eventually, stories will be tagged for easy search on topics depending on each visitor's need. We encourage everyone to share the stores anonymously. The purpose of this site is to gather stories and share them with everyone. That way if people want to share some articles in social networks nobody´s privacy will be violated.
        
        
        In the very first weeks, the site will allow users to share their stories by using a webform on the website, after they are evaluated by site’s moderators it will be published on the website. People can also request their stories to be removed if they feel it that way. Eventually everyone will be able to create their accounts and keep track of their own stories and decide if they are public or not.
        Even when stories are the main focus of the website, users could add some pictures to back up their stories if they feel they are necessary or that they add useful information. The pictures need to be about objects or spaces and no about real people in order to respect and protect everyone's privacy.
        
        There are few sites working with holiday stories. Giving the user the chance to upload their own stories in a simple yet appealing interface will help them decide to use our website to share them. Also the ability to share and read stories in a place where social media comments and likes won't distract from the real content.
